#Using loops to create multiple documents in R markdown

#a) Load libaries----
library(readr) #reading in data and writing out data
library(dplyr) #data wrangle
library(tidyverse) #learn more about the philosophy of tidy verse here
#https://www.tidyverse.org/

#b) Read in data----

#I only want the data for 2008 so I'll filter anything else out at this point
olympics <- read_csv("Data/Summer Olympic medallists 1896 to 2008.csv") %>%
  filter(Edition=="2008")

#c) Data wrangle

#Let's have a look at the data
dplyr::glimpse(olympics)

#Let's add a unique number to each athlete
olympics <- tibble::rowid_to_column(olympics, "ID")


#We can see that there are 2,042 medals that were awarded in 2008. I would like
#to send a letter of congratulations to every athlete that won a medal.

#I would also like the letters to be personalised and specific to the
#recipient, rather than a generic letter.

#In order to do this I'm going to use a loop which will create a vector
#for each athlete that won a medal. The vector will then be fed into 
#R Markdown to create the letters.

#The loop----
for (athletes in unique(olympics$ID)){
  rmarkdown::render('R Markdown Loop.Rmd',  
                    output_file =  paste(athletes, " Letter", ".docx", sep=''), 
                    output_dir = 'Exports')}
